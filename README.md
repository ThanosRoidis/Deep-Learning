# Deep-Learning

This is a repository containing all of the assignments for the Deep Learning master course at UvA for the fall semester of 2017.

##  Assignment 1
Implement and train a Multilayer Perceptron (in Numpy and TensorFlow) and a Convolutional Neural Network (in TensorFlow) for classification on CIFAR10

## Assignment 2
Implement and train a vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and a Long-Short Term Network (LSTM) in TensorFlow for text generation

## Assignment 3
Implement and train a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) in TensorFlow on the MNIST dataset
